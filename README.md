# [CoinMarketCap Subscription Bot](https://t.me/CoinMarketCapSubscriptionBot)

## Purpose
The bot's purpose is quite simple - to allow users to subscribe to a specific value (price, holders amount, liquidity) of token and/or pair user interested in and receive messages when the subsribed value reaches desired target.

_An example: [SHIB / WETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/ethereum/0xcf6daab95c476106eca715d48de4b13287ffdeaa/) pair. At the moment I write this description there is  **1,337,175 holders**. In case you want to be notified, when holders amount reaches 1.5M the bot can be useful._
